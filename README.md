# 3D-modelling

A repo to share 3D models I made while playing with [my 3D printer](https://www.creality.com/goods-detail/ender-3-3d-printer).
  
Models in .scad files can be viewed and rendered to .stl with [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org/).
Then you can run the .stl files through a slicer (I use [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura)), and print on your 3D printer if you have one.
